# URHackathon22
These are the codes that I used for my submission for UR data science hackathon 2022. I worked in a team of 2, to predict the gene expression differences from parents in the offspring. We used PANDAS to clean up the data, sklearn linear regression and principal component analysis to predict the gene expression differences. This repo contains my contribution to the final codes out of all the things we tried in the final submission.
